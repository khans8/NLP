cluster1_ = "i guess the issue is not the underlying comorbidity but whether the individual is taking medications for certain conditions that might interact with the alpha blocker specifically, if they are on certain anti-hypertensive meds which might increase the risk of orthostasis. seems like a small number of meds and patients but something the fda might raise what diagnosis specifically do you think might be delayed. that is an issue difficult to resolve., we might be able to avoid some long-term misuse by encouraging a medical evaluation after 3 months of use. if our concern is the as-yet-undiscovered diagnosis, this is a risk with just about all otcs which could delay an actual pathologic diagnosis that might be useful to know. this  this is a lot for a package insert but it might need to be done.for the organizer, it would be good at this stage to have a proposed argument for why no trial period in the us, and an unbiased discussion of the group of what conditions, if any, would be appropriate for a trial run (which might be handled by exclusionary labeling perhaps some abbreviated use of a risk/benefit ratio might be helpful in the insert. it might work in the uk where the pharmacist is the: gate keeper, but in the us the product would be available on the shelf without the need for a learned intermediary. this population likely might have co-morbidities as your research has suggested but the frequency of same should not factor against this. i do think that the fda will raise the issue of missed prostate cancer again and while claus is correct in stating that we now routinely use active surveillance in low-risk men, one might postulate that the men with prostate cancer causing luts (cause in quotations because, lets face it, its pretty rare that cap causes luts although we like to make that connection) are more likely to have higher risk cancer. i know that men will do what they choose, but if we recommend seeing a physician if the otc is being used for more than a specific amount of time or if the urinary condition is not improved, we might get more men in to see the physician. another way to encourage physician visits is to note a few symptoms/signs that might indicate something more serious and recommend a medical appointment. that being said, my experience with the agency has been that they often tend to be overly cautious- particularly in quality of life conditions. even though its just one case of bladder cancer, one wonders if perhaps the ad com might end up saying its one too many- particularly if they are lead that way by the fda officials (which i have also seen) i think the way to handle is to underscore that most of the things that might be missed are not going to be medically significant. many of the prostate cancer cases that might be are going to be indolent. a single case of low-grade bladder cancer missed is not a big deal. this might be approachable by advising men who are using the otc product successfully for more than 3 months should see a physician. perhaps an algorithm of questions that include family history risk factors, symptoms and signs might work better to identify these other conditions of concern. in response to daenerys targaryens comment about studying whether consumers can use a urine dipstick correctly it might be informative to know that in the tamsulosin otc program urine samples were analyzed initially by the pharmacy staff but then using a dipstick reader my comment is just to help think about what might come up if fda or the ac members disagree. your response is exactly what we were hoping to get as the goal of this virtual advisory board is just that: to think about what might come up if fda or the ac members disagree with the company position. again, as with some of my other comments, the open discussion on this should determine if there is any subtype of potential users of alphabs which might actually benefit from a dipstick test, and if so, then determine then how this might be handled in labeling (i.e., special precaution to some users, or contraindication to some users). the postmarketing experience data might be more in line with what one could expect in an otc environment than the experience in the rcts. however in an otc setting if the profile seen in otc vs rx setting is changing one would need to understand what is driving the fatal cv event. so it is not an absolute number but rather an event by event investigation especially if it is something that is being driven by an underlying disease or in a consumer who over-rode the label to select and use the product. one occurrence of a very rare event in the population more likely to have the event in the eneral population may more likely be viewed as unrelated to the treatment (depending on the moa of the treatment), but two less so, and in any case any deaths in a trial needs individual investigation, contextualized by the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial echoing the other comments, the risk is low in that sample for that duration that an event will occur which cannot be readily explained by actual circumstances of the subjects health history and the event itself. bladder cancer is a disease of the elderly as well and thus both occur together frequently. normal bp or htn, dm or not, all normal healthy with no risk factors for heart disease, previous mi or not, etc. what is the distribution of underlying disease. there are many causes of cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, certain types of cancer, drug therapy used to treat certain types of cancer, carotid and coronary artery disease. so it is not an absolute number but rather an event by event investigation especially if it is something that is being driven by an underlying disease or in a consumer who over-rode the label to select and use the product. further we do not know what consumer/pts where enrolled in the study, how many had cv disease at base lien so it really is a benefit vs risk assessment and absolute numbers dont always come into play.  i will try to address the last items here: clearly, many pts present with frequency, and nocturia when they are on antihypertensives specifically diuretics, they just dont put 2 and 2 together in that way. i have found many pts in the actual use study being on diuretics and having frequency. and actually in the actual use studies many pts state that they plan to bring it up with their doctor. in placebo control studies of men with bph / luts it may be as high a 2-5% it is interesting to note that one comorbid condition, prostate cancer, was mentioned as a caveat by the fda, but many of those pts we actually do not treat or discourage even the pursuit of a diagnosis. the potential types of consumers is vast as many men reported not seeing a hcp for their diagnosed pathology or not being compliant with the management regimen. the data generated in the studies that included a urine dipstick at baseline will be pooled to understand how many men followed up on this advice and if they didnt what their rationale was not to seek advice. there are many causes of cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, certain types of cancer, drug therapy used to treat certain types of cancer, carotid and coronary artery disease. how many had cv disease at base lien so it really is a benefit vs risk assessment and absolute numbers dont always come into play. how much of that really did happen in how many pts, ie n/n is what we need here. in other words i do think that they are appropriate the symptoms mentioned only can be confuse with underactive bladder which may have similar type symptoms, detrusor underactivity is a difficult to diagnose and not as common condition. from the wording of your question, i am assuming these are patients who are already dx with the condition. but is could also be extended to patients who have not been dx yet and trying to treat a symptom thus a concern, whether real or hypothetical, would be to prove that the underlying condition would not produce one of the symptoms you are trying to treat. also if a patient is being treated with a rx drug, could one of the side effects be one of the urinary tract condition listed above that the patient now tries to treat on their own with the otc product. also, patients who use tamsulosin otc over the counter can be encouraged to talk with their physician at some point to clarify their condition and see if some additional treatment is needed. in placebo control studies of men with bph / luts it may be as high a 2-5% it is interesting to note that one comorbid condition, prostate cancer, was mentioned as a caveat by the fda, but many of those pts we actually do not treat or discourage even the pursuit of a diagnosis. while the likelihood of an diagnosed condition may be low it is not zero and it is this issue that fda will raise to the advisory committee. i know that men will do what they choose, but if we recommend seeing a physician if the otc is being used for more than a specific amount of time or if the urinary condition is not improved, we might get more men in to see the physician. its a certainty that the issue of the potential risk of an undiagnosed condition will be raised. the company team has not approached the issue from that angle as there is no agreed upon definition of what constitutes a condition of importance and the agencys concern is not only linked to undiagnosed conditions but also exacerbations of or suboptimally treated or even untreated known pathology. i think fda will be concerned about those men who have a concomitant condition with bph/luts who obtain partial relief from tamsulosin hydrochloride, are comfortable enough with the improvement not to bother getting checked out, and dont discuss their symptoms with their physician. therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. question is how will you handle this as the otc label will not capture this condition of use for physicians. most - but perhaps not the agency - believe the dipstick is an unnecessary complication in this process with limited yield of what is called a medically relevant condition, i see little value in enclosing a dipstick. this group is not in favor and does not see a benefit in it, this appears to be the case but i think that it will be important to craft a cogent argument that will convince the fda and the non-urologists on the advisory committee of the same. that argument, i think, rests in demonstrating that the delay of diagnosis of an underlying serious medical condition is not of clinical significance however if it is occurring in consumers at ow risk and the drug is causing this it could be problem especially since the drug would be taken for chronic use and is being used to treat a lifestyle condition.  no i dont think so - we did this with oab and patients seem to be able to make correct decisions and understand their co-existent issues. the main issue is going to be whether or not the data are considered adequate to demonstrate that people who have not been diagnosed already with these comorbid conditions and take otc tamsulosin hydrochloride receive their diagnosis promptly. i guess the issue is not the underlying comorbidity but whether the individual is taking medications for certain conditions that might interact with the alpha blocker that is an issue dificult to resolve. issue will be to show what the potential consumer would do and back it with data. in reply to claus re pcp and uro prescribing of alphabs for luts/bph, an important issue is how the otc labelig matches up with the current standard of care provided by pcps and uros. the big issue is what happens with these undiagnosed men. i do think that the fda will raise the issue of missed prostate cancer again and while claus is correct in stating that we now routinely use active surveillance in low-risk men, one might postulate that the men with prostate cancer causing luts (cause in quotations because, lets face it, its pretty rare that cap causes luts although we like to make that connection) are more likely to have higher risk cancer. i personally think that this is probably not the case but i could see the fda raising this issue. while the likelihood of an diagnosed condition may be low it is not zero and it is this issue that fda will raise to the advisory committee. hard to win over physicians on the panel by saying the risk is acceptable: so it becomes a political issue even though it may have started as a medical issue, especially since the main issue has been missed prostate cancer. so from a pure regulatory point of view, while the risk may be low, the issue is not if it is acceptable it is what are the consequences of a misdiagnosis for the consumer. i really do not see how this issue can be raised by the fda in the current climate. diabetes and utis were an issue of discussion for oxytrol because there were concerns that delaying the diagnosis can lead to significant systemic illness fairly rapidly. the issue raised is the carcinoma in situ example) i would say that concern is low on my radar. its a certainty that the issue of the potential risk of an undiagnosed condition will be raised. the company team has not approached the issue from that angle as there is no agreed upon definition of what constitutes a condition of importance and the agency\s concern is not only linked to undiagnosed conditions but also exacerbations of or suboptimally treated or even untreated known pathology. thank you for helping us think these issues through. when the details of the analysis are known, if the conclusion is an increase in fatal cv events of any magnitude that cannot be explained by data collection issues will be a problem do you have other information that is more specific to the issue.  some of us on the team remember when the otc review actually used physician experience by testimony as valid support for otcness and labeling, but as we know this is a much more data-driven process. that being said, my experience with the agency has been that they often tend to be overly cautious- particularly in quality of life conditions. as aspect of this is that one cannot discount the tails of the distribution, but rather address it head on with facts, clinical experience defined by standards of care, and best of all data. our experience is that this allows for a more robust/uninhibited conversation. the postmarketing experience data might be more in line with what one could expect in an otc environment than the experience in the rcts. can anyone speak more about what is known about the symptoms of bladder cancer becoming more obvious once luts/bph symptoms are relieved in a man with both of these conditions. bladder cancer diagnosis delay may be a big concern for the adcom and for the fda. do we have any idea how frequently bladder cancer and luts/bph are present concomitantly? bladder cancer is a disease of the elderly as well and thus both occur together frequently. . the actual diagnoses of bladder cancer was very low in the first study where all pts had full evaluation by a urologist. bladder cancer detection is most the time based on hematuria, rarely due to urgency and frequency (that is often stated in textbooks but rarely happens in real life. of the 729 men who were referred for a urologic assessment in study 527.83, one subject had an undiagnosed bladder cancer. even though its just one case of bladder cancer, one wonders if perhaps the ad com might end up saying its one too many- particularly if they are lead that way by the fda officials (which i have also seen). a single case of low-grade bladder cancer missed is not a big deal. i dont know the exact number but i would expect it to be the same as the untreated male population as mentioned by one of the other respondents), i would like to know the death rate in the clinical trials and how that compares with what you are seeing in your actual use study. as the drug has been approved and marketed for a number of years you have a baseline to use as a comparison. so it is not an absolute number but rather an event by event investigation especially if it is something that is being driven by an underlying disease or in a consumer who over-rode the label to select and use the product.  in summary it is not just a number but understanding the reason for the events. seems like a small number of meds and patients but something the fda might raise. one problem is that few pts do that despite me giving them my cell phone number. that will be the perspective of a number of adv. and actually in the actual use studies many pts state that they plan to bring it up with their doctor. some of us on the team remember when the otc review actually used physician experience by testimony as valid support for otcness and labeling, but as we know this is a much more data-driven process. in placebo control studies of men with bph / luts it may be as high a 2-5% it is interesting to note that one comorbid condition, prostate cancer, was mentioned as a caveat by the fda, but many of those pts we actually do not treat or discourage even the pursuit of a diagnosis. i have to leave it to annelie or wade to actually infuse these data into the discussion. failing to get improvement of the symptoms of bph may actually serve to scare men in to making an appointment. as with the previous question, it is really important to survey and characterize what men who develop these symptoms are actually doing about it. or can it be demonstrated that some will actually consult a physician? if the ac and the fda get stuck on dipsticks, though, what is missing is the ability to see that consumers can actually dip the stick and see the color changes for blood, glucose, etc, read those changes and then understand what the changes mean. again, as with some of my other comments, the open discussion on this should determine if there is any subtype of potential users of alphabs which might actually benefit from a dipsick test, and if so, then determine then how this might be handled in labeling.

cluster2 = "i have found many pts in the actual use study being on diuretics and having frequency. it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product.it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product.do you have any info about why men did not but a second box in the exploratory actual use study .the actual diagnoses of bladder cancer was very low in the first study where all pts had full evaluation by a urologist. of the 729 men who were referred for a urologic assessment in study 527.83, one subject had an undiagnosed bladder cancer. this cancer was not causing or contributing to the urinary symptoms according to the study urologist. this specific individual reported that he saw his hcp on a very regular basis and had in fact see him/her within the month prior to study participation. list of msd, relevance of study rates to general population rates, importance of including people with known msd. this study examined the association between symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer risk in 5,068 placebo-arm participants enrolled in the prostate cancer prevention trial (1993–2003).analyses were completed by bph status at baseline (prevalent) or bph prior to cancer diagnosis or study end (prevalent plus incident). this study provides the strongest evidence to date that bph does not increase the risk of prostate cancer.in the final actual use study the urine dipstick was repeated at end-of-study if it was abnormal at baseline and data on why men choose not to speak to their doctor even after a repeat dipstick finding will be analyzed. in the study it appears that men were told that an abnormality was there and to see a doctor but were not asked to interpret the dipstick findings on their own. best to gives us a specific objective of the study, and some inclusion/exclusion criteria, along the line of my questions below. what were the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. i would like to know the death rate in the clinical trials and how that compares with what you are seeing in your actual use study.  i would also want to know the cause of each death and whether the death could be attributed to study drug or somehow to the use of the drug in the otc environment. further we do not know what consumer/pts where enrolled in the study, how many had cv disease at base lien so it really is a benefit vs risk assessment and absolute numbers dont always come into play. not that long ago we did a headache study on and nce which had mild antiplatelet properties, and a young female study participant had a hemorrhagic stroke in the study. and a young female study participant had a hemorrhagic stroke in the study. thus the rct study populations do not resemble an allcomers otc-simulated study population. thus the rct study populations do not resemble an allcomers otc-simulated study population. in other words i do think that they are appropriate the symptoms mentioned only can be confuse with underactive bladder which may have similar type symptoms, detrusor underactivity is a difficult to diagnose and not as common condition. from the wording of your question, i am assuming these are patients who are already dx with the condition. but is could also be extended to patients who have not been dx yet and trying to treat a symptom thus a concern, whether real or hypothetical, would be to prove that the underlying condition would not produce one of the symptoms you are trying to treat. also if a patient is being treated with a rx drug, could one of the side effects be one of the urinary tract condition listed above that the patient now tries to treat on their own with the otc product. also, patients who use tamsulosin otc over the counter can be encouraged to talk with their physician at some point to clarify their condition and see if some additional treatment is needed. in placebo control studies of men with bph / luts it may be as high a 2-5% it is interesting to note that one comorbid condition, prostate cancer, was mentioned as a caveat by the fda, but many of those pts we actually do not treat or discourage even the pursuit of a diagnosis. while the likelihood of an diagnosed condition may be low it is not zero and it is this issue that fda will raise to the advisory committee. i know that men will do what they choose, but if we recommend seeing a physician if the otc is being used for more than a specific amount of time or if the urinary condition is not improved, we might get more men in to see the physician. its a certainty that the issue of the potential risk of an undiagnosed condition will be raised. the company team has not approached the issue from that angle as there is no agreed upon definition of what constitutes a condition of importance and the agencys concern is not only linked to undiagnosed conditions but also exacerbations of or suboptimally treated or even untreated known pathology. i think fda will be concerned about those men who have a concomitant condition with bph/luts who obtain partial relief from tamsulosin hydrochloride, are comfortable enough with the improvement not to bother getting checked out, and dont discuss their symptoms with their physician. therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. question is how will you handle this as the otc label will not capture this condition of use for physicians. most - but perhaps not the agency - believe the dipstick is an unnecessary complication in this process with limited yield of what is called a medically relevant condition, i see little value in enclosing a dipstick. this group is not in favor and does not see a benefit in it, this appears to be the case but i think that it will be important to craft a cogent argument that will convince the fda and the non-urologists on the advisory committee of the same. that argument, i think, rests in demonstrating that the delay of diagnosis of an underlying serious medical condition is not of clinical significance. however if it is occurring in consumers at ow risk and the drug is causing this it could be problem especially since the drug would be taken for chronic use and is being used to treat a lifestyle condition. the main issue is going to be whether or not the data are considered adequate to demonstrate that people who have not been diagnosed already with these comorbid conditions and take otc tamsulosin hydrochloride receive their diagnosis promptly. if the data are adequate to show that the otc drug does not delay the diagnosis long enough to result in adverse consequences then this should be acceptable. issue will be to show what the potential consumer would do and back it with data. do you have data regarding how internists or family practice physicians prescribe tamsulosin. it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product. the more that can be done to have data to demonstrate patient demographics, refill rates (and non-refill rates), reasons for decisions to continue or to stop, to seek a md visit or not, etc. the better for the argument. some of us on the team remember when the otc review actually used physician experience by testimony as valid support for otcness and labeling, but as we know this is a much more data-driven process. the complement is, do the data demonstrate that the physician selection of men suitable for alphabs is reasonably comparable to self-selection, wherein through this answer the label is shown adequate. the biggest risk is urinary retention which we know from the 5 alpha reductase data occurs in a small per cent on an annual basis- but results in little real morbidity wade can perhaps provide actual data. what specific data do you have to support your viewpoint. as aspect of this is that one cannot discount the tails of the distribution, but rather address it head on with facts, clinical experience defined by standards of care, and best of all data. i reiterate my call for an infusion of data into this blog. there are data from the early studies in which all men with any findings underwent full evaluation by a urologist. these data suggest a fairly low incidence of medically significant diseases.  i have to leave it to annelie or wade to actually infuse these data into the discussion. we dont know from current data as a unknown (i suspect very large) bias exists. these data include 1,225 men whose cancer was detected during the 7-year trial—556 detected for cause (following abnormal prostate-specific antigen or digital rectal examination) and 669 detected not for cause (without indication), as well as 3,843 men who had biopsy-proven absence of prostate cancer at the trial end. the data generated in the studies that included a urine dipstick at baseline will be pooled to understand how many men followed up on this advice and if they didnt what their rationale was not to seek advice. in the final actual use study the urine dipstick was repeated at end-of-study if it was abnormal at baseline and data on why men choose not to speak to their doctor even after a repeat dipstick finding will be analyzed. it appears that you dont plan to use a dipstick anyway because company feels the data werent suggestive that it was not needed. im okay with this, but would like to know the specific data (preferably publications) that support this, and what the standards of care used by pcps and uros states on this subject. in the absence of data that demonstrates the the dipstick is necessary to properly use the product, the inclusion adds an unnecessary layer of complexity to using the product correctly, lets put question # 3 to rest. i have to ask again for wade to perhaps provide some data. when the details of the analysis are known, if the conclusion is an increase in fatal cv events of any magnitude that cannot be explained by data collection issues will be a problem. the postmarketing experience data might be more in line with what one could expect in an otc environment than the experience in the rcts. an internal evaluation of the safety data relating to cardiovascular events and tamsulosin was performed and the results do not support a causal relationship. as part of the nda submission a full analysis will be performed on all available pharmacovigilance databases (external and internal) to assess this relationship further. i agree that the cdc data are not helpful. is there data available to this effect. i feel that the members of the adboard have a difficult time making statements in what essentially is a data vacuum. i feel that the members of the adboard have a difficult time making statements in what essentially is a data vacuum?!, yes, data helps drive conclusions and sort through opinions.  issue will be to show what the potential consumer would do and back it with data. i would eliminate as this is one more thing that will be a speed bump the consumer will have to get right to use the product correctly. the labeling should be adequate to drive the consumer to the physician if necessary. so it is not an absolute number but rather an event by event investigation especially if it is something that is being driven by an underlying disease or in a consumer who over-rode the label to select and use the product. specifically, if they are on certain anti-hypertensive meds which might increase the risk of orthostasis. if our concern is the as-yet-undiscovered diagnosis, this is a risk with just about all otcs which could delay an actual pathologic diagnosis that might be useful to know. this is a known risk of otcs. how do you think the populations in a typical practice compare with the proposed otc population with regard to risk. perhaps some abbreviated use of a risk/benefit ratio might be helpful in the insert. but to get the man to think like a doctor may require some unique way of designing an algorithm and/or noting risk/benefit considerations rather than simply displaying a list of information. a couple of comments ago, daenerys stated how do you think the populations in a typical practice compare with the proposed otc population with regard to risk. but how do studies convincingly demonstrate that populations in a typical practice compare with the proposed otc population with regard to risk. these may or may not be accurate. there is always a risk that consumers will use otc for misinterpreted reasons all that can be done is to try to put the indications, and the algorithm to help men decide whether or not this medicine is right for them, in as clear language as possible. so the incremental risk of trying tamsulosin hydrochloride would be low, as long as there are no contraindications. the biggest risk is urinary retention which we know from the 5 alpha reductase data occurs in a small per cent on an annual basis- but results in little real morbidity, indeed, aur has an incidence of 1% or 1 out of 100 men per year in population based studies. the likelihood of undiagnosed medically significant conditions is there. can you address the risk on a population basis. i do think that the fda will raise the issue of missed prostate cancer again and while claus is correct in stating that we now routinely use active surveillance in low-risk men. its pretty rare that cap causes luts although we like to make that connection) are more likely to have higher risk cancer. hard to win over physicians on the panel by saying the risk is acceptable: so it becomes a political issue even though it may have started as a medical issue, especially since the main issue has been missed prostate cancer. so from a pure regulatory point of view, while the risk may be low,the issue is not if it is acceptable it is what are the consequences of a misdiagnosis for the consumer. perhaps the otc algorithm needs to be clear about other potential risks and encourage men to visit a physician for regular check-up. its a certainty that the issue of the potential risk of an undiagnosed condition will be raised. i think a more systematic approach should be taken to answering this, and would like to suggest to the organizer/company to present into the discussion an safety algorithm that depicts types of consumers by diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions of importance, including the type of information/studies that mitigate concern with that putative risk. we dont know from current data as a unknown (i suspect very large) bias exists. heretofore as such patients are weaned out prior to evaluation, it seems to me that the risk to individuals with significant conditions that have not been diagnosed is not great with a 2 to 4 week trial of the product. this study examined the association between symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer risk in 5,068 placebo-arm participants enrolled in the prostate cancer prevention trial (1993–2003). this study provides the strongest evidence to date that bph does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. it would detect very few of the co-morbid conditions of concern. perhaps an algorithm of questions that include family history risk factors, symptoms and signs might work better to identify these other conditions of concern. normal bp or htn, dm or not, all normal healthy with no risk factors for heart disease, previous mi or not, etc. however if it is occurring in consumers at ow risk and the drug is causing this it could be problem especially since the drug would be taken for chronic use and is being used to treat a lifestyle condition. further we do not know what consumer/pts where enrolled in the study, how many had cv disease at base lien so it really is a benefit vs risk assessment and absolute numbers dont always come into play. echoing the other comments, the risk is low in that sample for that duration that an event will occur which cannot be readily explained by actual circumstances of the subjects health history and the event itself. as is often the case, the sponsor has to accept a small risk that a serious ae occurs which is possibly drug related and cannot be readily explained. no we did not, i do not believe an otc product currently available uses the word \trial\ or \trial run\ on the label. this would seem somewhat unorthodox as well. what is on the label is the instruction to see your doctor if you have no improvement or worsening or such language. the label is the surrogate for the clinician. if an drug-drug interaction or a specific contraindication is needed for the product to be approved otc, the caution must be on the label and understood by the consumer. yes, otcness is predicated on the label, suitable evidence of label comprehension, and to the extent that the aus provides evidence of how self-selecting consumers behave in the context of the label, and the drug being studies in the aus. the complement is, do the data demonstrate that the physician selection of men suitable for alphabs is reasonably comparable to self-selection, wherein through this answer the label is shown adequate. plus the label and insert should be demonstrated to drive increased physician interactions. we can debate what the incidence is of undiagnosed conditions but key will be is you are suggesting that the otc label and conditions of use will be different than the rx label. we can debate what the incidence is of undiagnosed conditions but key will be is you are suggesting that the otc label and conditions of use will be different than the rx label. question is how will you handle this as the otc label will not capture this condition of use for physicians. (just thoughts for consideration-are you suggesting that the rx label will be changes or different than the otc label). so it is not an absolute number but rather an event by event investigation

demonstrate that the physician selection of men suitable for alphabs is reasonably comparable to self-selection. plus the label and insert should be demonstrated to drive increased physician interactions is there a way that an otc can be available but it does not significantly delay seeing a physician. but if we recommend seeing a physician if the otc is being used for more than a specific amount of time or if the urinary condition is not improved. we might get more men in to see the physician. perhaps the otc algorithm needs to be clear about other potential risks and encourage men to visit a physician for regular check-up.  another way to encourage physician visits is to note a few symptoms/signs that might indicate something more serious and recommend a medical appointment. i think that if you can show that there is a substantial lag time between symptom onset and seeking physician input for luts conditions other than bph then you can easily make the argument that a 2-week use of otc tamsulosin hydrochloride wont be clinically meaningful in that context. are comfortable enough with the improvement not to bother getting checked out, and dont discuss their symptoms with their physician. this might be approachable by advising men who are using the otc product successfully for more than 3 months should see a physician. failure to improve symptoms may in fact serve to drive the individual to see a physician in general. men are less likely to see a physician except for an annual physical symptomatic bph was assessed hierarchically as self-report of surgical or medical treatment, moderately severe symptoms (international prostate symptom score >14), or physician diagnosis. this lack of association was consistent across subgroups defined by type of bph-defining event (treatment, symptoms, or physician diagnosis), prompt for prostate cancer diagnosis or can it be demonstrated that some will actually consult a physician. the labeling should be adequate to drive the consumer to the physician if necessary. no i dont think so - we did this with oab and patients seem to be able to make correct decisions and understand their co-existent issues. the main issue is going to be whether or not the data are considered adequate to demonstrate that people who have not been diagnosed already with these comorbid conditions and take otc tamsulosin hydrochloride receive their diagnosis promptly. i guess the issue is not the underlying comorbidity but whether the individual is taking medications for certain conditions that might interact with the alpha blocker. that is an issue dificult to resolve. issue will be to show what the potential consumer would do and back it with data. in reply to claus re pcp and uro prescribing of alphabs for luts/bph, an important issue is how the otc labelig matches up with the current standard of care provided by pcps and uros. the big issue is what happens with these undiagnosed men. i do think that the fda will raise the issue of missed prostate cancer again and while claus is correct in stating that we now routinely use active surveillance in low-risk men, one might postulate that the men with prostate cancer causing luts (cause in quotations because, lets face it, its pretty rare that cap causes luts although we like to make that connection) are more likely to have higher risk cancer. i personally think that this is probably not the case but i could see the fda raising this issue. while the likelihood of an diagnosed condition may be low it is not zero and it is this issue that fda will raise to the advisory committee. hard to win over physicians on the panel by saying the risk is acceptable: so it becomes a political issue even though it may have started as a medical issue, especially since the main issue has been missed prostate cancer. so from a pure regulatory point of view, while the risk may be low, the issue is not if it is acceptable it is what are the consequences of a misdiagnosis for the consumer. i really do not see how this issue can be raised by the fda in the current climate. diabetes and utis were an issue of discussion for oxytrol because there were concerns that delaying the diagnosis can lead to significant systemic illness fairly rapidly. the issue raised is the carcinoma in situ example) i would say that concern is low on my radar. its a certainty that the issue of the potential risk of an undiagnosed condition will be raised. the company team has not approached the issue from that angle as there is no agreed upon definition of what constitutes a condition of importance and the agency\s concern is not only linked to undiagnosed conditions but also exacerbations of or suboptimally treated or even untreated known pathology.

extent that the aus provides evidence of how self-selecting consumers behave in the context of the label, and the drug being studies in the aus. the small percent in your studies will still translate into a lot of men in actual numbers who will have these undiagnosed conditions once the drug is otc. if the medication gets them to the doctor sooner than later, then the otc drug may offer a benefit and wont be harmful. an agree a dipstick is not necessary and will overly complicate the otc paradigm with a drug and a device. there are many causes of cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, certain types of cancer, drug therapy used to treat certain types of cancer, carotid and coronary artery disease. i would also want to know the cause of each death and whether the death could be attributed to study drug or somehow to the use of the drug in the otc environment. i would also want to know the cause of each death and whether the death could be attributed to study drug or somehow to the use of the drug in the otc environment were any due to syncope secondary to the drug. as the drug has been approved and marketed for a number of years you have a baseline to use as a comparison. however if it is occurring in consumers at ow risk and the drug is causing this it could be problem especially since the drug would be taken for chronic use and is being used to treat a lifestyle condition. however if it is occurring in consumers at ow risk and the drug is causing this it could be problem especially since the drug would be taken for chronic use and is being used to

your question, i am assuming these are patients who are already dx with the condition. the question is better stated, not as how do you think (i.e., opine), but how do studies convincingly demonstrate that populations in a typical practice compare with the proposed otc population with regard to risk. this is an interesting question and, at this point, can only be determined by focus groups and/or simulation exercises. you are right but you are assuming that they are accountable to one another- which they arent, this is a good question that is hard to answer. as with the previous question, it is really important to survey and characterize what men who develop these symptoms are actually doing about it. this group is not in favor and does not see a benefit in it, this appears to be the case but i think that it will be important to craft a cogent argument that will convince the fda and the non-urologists on the advisory committee of the same. gregor, i think that doing such is a mistake, im coming in late with my response to the first round of question, having spent the last week away from westeros. i.e. 2 / 1000, as below, ps i appreciate the thrones reference but would prefer to be jon snow, this is a question without key information. why is ‘adverse’ in the question. dear advisors, for this question we provided you with a link to the cdc’s deaths and mortality statistics webpage to help with answering this question."

important. the short delay in diagnosis if it is something real wont change the long term outcome. i agree that the key is to be able to demonstrate that if there is a delay in diagnosis (and there will be in the otc setting) that the delay will be short and not of clinical consequence. i think that there is a case to be made that there is a difference between a delay in diagnosis and a missed diagnosis. symptomatic bph was assessed hierarchically as self-report of surgical or medical treatment, moderately severe symptoms (international prostate symptom score >14), or physician diagnosis,

hypocritical for our government to say through the uspstf no to any and all psa testing in any men, and then say through the fda that we must make sure we dont miss the prostate cancer diagnosis. many of the prostate cancer cases that might be are going to be indolent. as noted in the warning section of the rx insert:  screening for prostate cancer prostate cancer and bph frequently co-exist. therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards.  shenk j et al. association of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial. this study examined the association between symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia

bph-defining event (treatment, symptoms, or physician diagnosis), prompt for prostate cancer diagnosis, and prostate cancer grade. this study provides the strongest evidence to date that bph does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. i still think that they can, these are all the types of concerns that an advisory committee would have and the sponsor needs to make a clear case that men are coping with these conditions for long periods of time (months or years) without consulting an hcp. i personally think that this is probably not the case but i could see the fda raising this issue. even though its just one case of bladder cancer, one wonders if perhaps the ad com might end up saying its one too many- particularly if they are lead that way by the fda officials (which i have also seen). a single case of low-grade bladder cancer missed is not a big deal. i think that there is a case to be made that there is a difference between a delay in diagnosis and a missed diagnosis. this group is not in favor and does not see a benefit in it, this appears to be the case but i think that it will be important to craft a cogent argument that will convince the fda and the non-urologists on the advisory committee of the same. one occurrence of a very rare event in the population more likely to have the event in the eneral population may more likely be viewed as unrelated to the treatment (depending on the moa of the treatment), but two less so, and in any case any deaths in a trial needs individual investigation, contextualized by the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial. i think that more relevant is the comparison of the populations in the rx clinical trials and the population in the aus and the specifics of each death case. as is often the case, the sponsor has to accept a small risk that a serious ae occurs which is possibly drug related and cannot be readily explained. if you will, most pts are given a rx on a trial basis, but not for 2 wks, usually for much longer. if the standards of care include a trial run, and that is the uk model, perhaps the discussion should move to why no trial run (e.g., 30 days). for the organizer, it would be good at this stage to have a proposed argument for why no trial period in the u.s., and an unbiased discussion of the group of what conditions, if any, would be appropriate for a trial run (which might be handled by exclusionary labeling., it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product. no we did not, i do not believe an otc product currently available uses the word \trial\ or \trial run\ on the label. i would argue that essentially is the essence of a \trial\ and what providers do. all conditions where md involvement is needed, not self treatment, proposing a trial run after a brief use of the product is not a workable approach. heretofore as such patients are weaned out prior to evaluation, it seems to me that the risk to individuals with significant conditions that have not been diagnosed is not great with a 2 to 4 week trial of the product. shenk j et al. association of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial. this study examined the association between symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer risk in 5,068 placebo-arm participants enrolled in the prostate cancer prevention trial (1993–2003).  these data include 1,225 men whose cancer was detected during the 7-year trial—556 detected for cause (following abnormal prostate-specific antigen or digital rectal examination) and 669 detected not for cause (without indication), as well as 3,843 men who had biopsy-proven absence of prostate cancer at the trial end.  in general, however, a trial of 1,000 could easily miss uncommon and rare events. subject has not participated in any clinical trial within the past 12 months. one occurrence of a very rare event in the population more likely to have the event in the eneral population may more likely be viewed as unrelated to the treatment (depending on the moa of the treatment), but two less so, and in any case any deaths in a trial needs individual investigation, contextualized by the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial. but is could also be extended to patients who have not been dx yet and trying to treat a symptom thus a concern, whether real or hypothetical, would be to prove that the underlying condition would not produce one of the symptoms you are trying to treat. i think that if you can show that there is a substantial lag time between symptom onset and seeking physician input for luts conditions other than bph then you can easily make the argument that a 2-week use of otc tamsulosin hydrochloride wont be clinically meaningful in that context. symptomatic bph was assessed hierarchically as self-report of surgical or medical treatment, moderately severe symptoms (international prostate symptom score >14), or physician diagnosis, and analyses were completed by bph status at baseline (prevalent) or bph prior to cancer diagnosis or study end (prevalent plus incident). i agree that the symptoms may partially overlap, but even md provider will likely give alpha blocker to those pts as they do not have a full uds examination to review. i agree. ., i hear what everyone is saying and tend to agree with you. i agree that the key is to be able to demonstrate that if there is a delay in diagnosis (and there will be in the otc setting) that the delay will be short and not of clinical consequence. cant speak for the fda but i think its overkill, agree. agree with other comment to date, i believe we can put this to rest. agree a dipstick is not necessary and will overly complicate the otc paradigm with a drug and a device. i agree, as stated earlier, more information and context is needed. i agree that the cdc data are not helpful.  the main issue is going to be whether or not the data are considered adequate to demonstrate that people who have not been diagnosed already with these comorbid conditions and take otc tamsulosin hydrochloride receive their diagnosis promptly. if the data are adequate to show that the otc drug does not delay the diagnosis long enough to result in adverse consequences then this should be acceptable. issue will be to show what the potential consumer would do and back it with data. do you have data regarding how internists or family practice physicians prescribe tamsulosin. it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product. the more that can be done to have data to demonstrate patient demographics, refill rates (and non-refill rates), reasons for decisions to continue or to stop, to seek a md visit or not, etc. the better for the argument. some of us on the team remember when the otc review actually used physician experience by testimony as valid support for otcness and labeling, but as we know this is a much more data-driven process. the complement is, do the data demonstrate that the physician selection of men suitable for alphabs is reasonably comparable to self-selection, wherein through this answer the label is shown adequate. the biggest risk is urinary retention which we know from the 5 alpha reductase data occurs in a small per cent on an annual basis- but results in little real morbidity. wade can perhaps provide actual data. what specific data do you have to support your viewpoint. as aspect of this is that one cannot discount the tails of the distribution, but rather address it head on with facts, clinical experience defined by standards of care, and best of all data. i reiterate my call for an infusion of data into this blog. there are data from the early studies in which all men with any findings underwent full evaluation by a urologist. these data suggest a fairly low incidence of medically significant diseases. i have to leave it to annelie or wade to actually infuse these data into the discussion. we dont know from current data as a unknown (i suspect very large) bias exists. these data include 1,225 men whose cancer was detected during the 7-year trial—556 detected for cause (following abnormal prostate-specific antigen or digital rectal examination) and 669 detected not for cause (without indication), as well as 3,843 men who had biopsy-proven absence of prostate cancer at the trial end. the data generated in the studies that included a urine dipstick at baseline will be pooled to understand how many men followed up on this advice and if they didnt what their rationale was not to seek advice. in the final actual use study the urine dipstick was repeated at end-of-study if it was abnormal at baseline and data on why men choose not to speak to their doctor even after a repeat dipstick finding will be analyzed. it appears that you dont plan to use a dipstick anyway because company feels the data werent suggestive that it was not needed. im okay with this, but would like to know the specific data (preferably publications) that support this, and what the standards of care used by pcps and uros states on this subject. in the absence of data that demonstrates the the dipstick is necessary to properly use the product, the inclusion adds an unnecessary layer of complexity to using the product correctly, lets put question # 3 to rest. i have to ask again for wade to perhaps provide some data. when the details of the analysis are known, if the conclusion is an increase in fatal cv events of any magnitude that cannot be explained by data collection issues will be a problem. the postmarketing experience data might be more in line with what one could expect in an otc environment than the experience in the rcts. an internal evaluation of the safety data relating to cardiovascular events and tamsulosin was performed and the results do not support a causal relationship. as part of the nda submission a full analysis will be performed on all available pharmacovigilance databases (external and internal) to assess this relationship further. i agree that the cdc data are not helpful. is there data available to this effect.  i feel that the members of the adboard have a difficult time making statements in what essentially is a data vacuum. i feel that the members of the adboard have a difficult time making statements in what essentially is a data vacuum?!, yes, data helps drive conclusions and sort through opinions.  i have found many pts in the actual use study being on diuretics and having frequency. it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product. it would seem from the data collected in the exploratory actual use study that men do mimic the trial run if you like as 36.7% only purchased 1 box of study drug and never returned to the participating pharmacy to repurchase product. do you have any info about why men did not but a second box in the exploratory actual use study. the actual diagnoses of bladder cancer was very low in the first study where all pts had full evaluation by a urologist. of the 729 men who were referred for a urologic assessment in study 527.83, one subject had an undiagnosed bladder cancer. this cancer was not causing or contributing to the urinary symptoms according to the study urologist. this specific individual reported that he saw his hcp on a very regular basis and had in fact see him/her within the month prior to study participation. list of msd, relevance of study rates to general population rates, importance of including people with known msd. this study examined the association between symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer risk in 5,068 placebo-arm participants enrolled in the prostate cancer prevention trial (1993–2003). analyses were completed by bph status at baseline (prevalent) or bph prior to cancer diagnosis or study end (prevalent plus incident).  this study provides the strongest evidence to date that bph does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. in the final actual use study the urine dipstick was repeated at end-of-study if it was abnormal at baseline and data on why men choose not to speak to their doctor even after a repeat dipstick finding will be analyzed. in the study it appears that men were told that an abnormality was there and to see a doctor but were not asked to interpret the dipstick findings on their own. best to gives us a specific objective of the study, and some inclusion/exclusion criteria, along the line of my questions below. what were the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. i would like to know the death rate in the clinical trials and how that compares with what you are seeing in your actual use study. i would also want to know the cause of each death and whether the death could be attributed to study drug or somehow to the use of the drug in the otc environment. further we do not know what consumer/pts where enrolled in the study, how many had cv disease at base lien so it really is a benefit vs risk assessment and absolute numbers dont always come into play. not that long ago we did a headache study on and nce which had mild antiplatelet properties, and a young female study participant had a hemorrhagic stroke in the study. and a young female study participant had a hemorrhagic stroke in the study. thus the rct study populations do not resemble an allcomers otc-simulated study population.  i guess the issue is not the underlying comorbidity but whether the individual is taking medications for certain conditions that might interact with the alpha blocker. specifically, if they are on certain anti-hypertensive meds which might increase the risk of orthostasis. seems like a small number of meds and patients but something the fda might raise what diagnosis specifically do you think might be delayed. that is an issue difficult to resolve., we might be able to avoid some long-term misuse by encouraging a medical evaluation after 3 months of use. if our concern is the as-yet-undiscovered diagnosis, this is a risk with just about all otcs which could delay an actual pathologic diagnosis that might be useful to know. this is a known risk of otcs. this is a lot for a package insert but it might need to be done. for the organizer, it would be good at this stage to have a proposed argument for why no trial period in the us, and an unbiased discussion of the group of what conditions, if any, would be appropriate for a trial run (which might be handled by exclusionary labeling. perhaps some abbreviated use of a risk/benefit ratio might be helpful in the insert. it might work in the uk where the pharmacist is the: gate keeper, but in the us the product would be available on the shelf without the need for a learned intermediary. this population likely might have co-morbidities as your research has suggested but the frequency of same should not factor against this. i do think that the fda will raise the issue of missed prostate cancer again and while claus is correct in stating that we now routinely use active surveillance in low-risk men, one might postulate that the men with prostate cancer causing luts (cause in quotations because, lets face it, its pretty rare that cap causes luts although we like to make that connection) are more likely to have higher risk cancer. i know that men will do what they choose, but if we recommend seeing a physician if the otc is being used for more than a specific amount of time or if the urinary condition is not improved, we might get more men in to see the physician. another way to encourage physician visits is to note a few symptoms/signs that might indicate something more serious and recommend a medical appointment. that being said, my experience with the agency has been that they often tend to be overly cautious- particularly in quality of life conditions. even though its just one case of bladder cancer, one wonders if perhaps the ad com might end up saying its one too many- particularly if they are lead that way by the fda officials (which i have also seen). i think the way to handle is to underscore that most of the things that might be missed are not going to be medically significant. many of the prostate cancer cases that might be are going to be indolent. a single case of low-grade bladder cancer missed is not a big deal. this might be approachable by advising men who are using the otc product successfully for more than 3 months should see a physician. perhaps an algorithm of questions that include family history risk factors, symptoms and signs might work better to identify these other conditions of concern. in response to daenerys targaryens comment about studying whether consumers can use a urine dipstick correctly it might be informative to know that in the tamsulosin otc program urine samples were analyzed initially by the pharmacy staff but then using a dipstick reader. my comment is just to help think about what might come up if fda or the ac members disagree. your response is exactly what we were hoping to get as the goal of this virtual advisory board is just that: to think about what might come up if fda or the ac members disagree with the company position. again, as with some of my other comments, the open discussion on this should determine if there is any subtype of potential users of alphabs which might actually benefit from a dipstick test, and if so, then determine then how this might be handled in labeling (i.e., special precaution to some users, or contraindication to some users). the postmarketing experience data might be more in line with what one could expect in an otc environment than the experience in the rcts."
